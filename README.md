## Introduction

This repository is a collection of 150+ Python problems that I have created to help both beginners and experienced programmers practice and improve their coding skills. Each problem comes with a detailed solution to help you understand the concepts and logic behind it.

## Problems List

The problems are categorized into different sections for easier navigation:

1. **Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)**
2. **Basic operations (arithmetic, comparison, logical)**
3. **Strings and string manipulation**
4. **Lists, tuples, and dictionaries**
5. **Conditional statements (if, elif, else)**
6. **Loops (for loops, while loops)**
7. **Functions (defining functions, parameters, return values)**
8. **Scope of variables (global vs. local)**
9. **More on lists (list comprehensions, slicing)**
10. **Sets and set operations**
11. **Dictionaries (dictionary comprehensions, methods)**
12. **Collections module (deque, Counter, defaultdict)**
13. **Reading and writing files**
